[Text to display][identifier] will display a link.

[Another text][another-identifier] will do the same. Hover the mouse over it to see the title.

[This link] will do the same as well. It works as the identifier itself.

[This link][] (same as above), has a second pair of empty brackets to indicate that the following parenthesis does not contain a link.

<https://example.com> works too. Must be used for explicit links.

<!-- Identifiers, in alphabetical order -->

[another-identifier]: https://example.com "This example has a title"
[identifier]: http://example1.com
[this link]: http://example2.com
